# ✅ MEDICAL FORM DATA FIXED!

## 🐛 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

### **Issue:**
The medical form was showing all "N/A" values because there were **two different form systems** that weren't properly integrated:

1. **AppointmentController** - Creates appointments with basic medical data
2. **FormController** - Handles separate medical form completion

### **Root Cause:**
- Appointments were created with basic medical data structure
- View form expected different field names
- Data wasn't being properly mapped between systems

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

### **Fixed Data Mapping:**
```php
// Handle different data structures
if (empty($formData) || !isset($formData['patient_name'])) {
    // If no form data, use user profile data
    $formData = [
        'patient_name' => $appointment->client->name ?? 'N/A',
        'date_of_birth' => $appointment->client->date_of_birth ?? 'N/A',
        'phone' => $appointment->client->phone ?? 'N/A',
        'email' => $appointment->client->email ?? 'N/A',
        'address' => $appointment->client->address ?? 'N/A',
        'date' => $appointment->appointment_date->format('Y-m-d'),
        'age' => $appointment->client->date_of_birth ? \Carbon\Carbon::parse($appointment->client->date_of_birth)->age : 'N/A',
        'procedure' => $appointment->service->service_name ?? 'N/A',
        // ... more fields
    ];
}
```

## 🔧 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### **Data Source Priority:**
1. **First:** Check if medical form data exists
2. **Second:** If not, use user profile data
3. **Third:** Use appointment data
4. **Fallback:** Show "N/A" if nothing available

### **Data Mapping:**
- ✅ **Patient Name** → User's name from profile
- ✅ **Date of Birth** → User's DOB from profile
- ✅ **Phone/Email** → User's contact info from profile
- ✅ **Address** → User's address from profile
- ✅ **Procedure** → Appointment service name
- ✅ **Form Date** → Appointment date
- ✅ **Age** → Calculated from user's DOB

```
Click "View Form" button on any appointment
