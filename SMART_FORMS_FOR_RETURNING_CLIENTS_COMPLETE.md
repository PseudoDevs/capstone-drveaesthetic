2. **For returning clients:**
   - Loads previous form data automatically
   - Displays welcome message
   - Pre-fills ALL form fields
   - Shows "✅ Auto-filled" helper texts
   - Allows client to review and update

3. **Data auto-filled:**
   - Patient name
   - Address/residence
   - Medical history (allergies, diabetes, etc.)
   - Lifestyle (smoker, drinker, pregnant, etc.)
   - Maintenance medications
   - Civil status
   - Age
   - Previous services availed
   - All other form fields

## 📊 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **How Detection Works:**

**Query:**
```php
$previousAppointment = Appointment::where('client_id', $clientId)
    ->whereNotNull('form_data')
    ->latest('created_at')
    ->first();
```

**Logic:**
- Checks for appointments by current client
- Requires form data to exist
- Gets most recent appointment
- Uses that data for auto-fill

### **Data Sources:**

**Priority order for auto-fill:**
1. **Previous form data** (highest priority)
2. **User profile data** (fallback)
3. **Empty** (if no data)

Example:
```php
->default(fn () => $previousData['patient_name'] ?? $user->name)
```

### **Fields Auto-Filled:**

**Medical Information Form:**
- patient_name
- address
- procedure
- allergy (checkbox)
- diabetes (checkbox)
- thyroid_diseases (checkbox)

- heart_diseases (checkbox)
- kidney_diseases (checkbox)
- hypertension (checkbox)
- asthma (checkbox)
- medical_history_others
- pregnant (checkbox)
- lactating (checkbox)
- smoker (checkbox)
- alcoholic_drinker (checkbox)
- maintenance_medications

**Consent Waiver Form:**

## 🔐 **DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY**

### **Privacy Considerations:**

✅ **Per-client data** - Only shows client's own previous data

✅ **No data sharing** - Each client sees only their data  
✅ **Audit trail** - All form submissions tracked  

### **What's NOT Auto-Filled:**

❌ **Consent checkboxes** - Must be checked fresh each time (legal requirement)  
❌ **Signatures** - Fresh signature required
