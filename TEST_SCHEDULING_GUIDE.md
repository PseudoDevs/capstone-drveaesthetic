## 🎯 **How to Test the New Scheduling Logic**

Follow these steps to verify the scheduling rules are working correctly:

---

## 📋 **PREPARATION**

1. **Start your Laravel server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Open your browser:** `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Login to Staff Panel:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/admin/staff`
   - Email: `ullrich.deborah@example.org`
   - Password: `password`

---

## ✅ **TEST SCENARIO 1: Different Services, Same Time (Should ALLOW)**

### **Step 1: Create First Appointment**
1. Go to **Appointments** in Staff Panel
2. Click **"Create Appointment"** or use the quick create
3. Fill in:
   - **Client:** Any client (e.g., "Josefa Lind")
   - **Service:** "Botox Injection"
   - **Staff:** "Stacey Weimann" (Doctor)
   - **Date:** Tomorrow's date
   - **Time:** "10:00 AM"
   - **Status:** "Scheduled"
4. Click **"Create"**
5. ✅ **Should succeed:** Appointment created successfully

### **Step 2: Create Second Appointment (Different Service)**
1. Click **"Create Appointment"** again
2. Fill in:
   - **Client:** Different client (e.g., "Deja Feil")
   - **Service:** "Chemical Peel" ← **DIFFERENT SERVICE**
   - **Staff:** "Stacey Weimann" ← **SAME STAFF**
   - **Date:** Same date as first
   - **Time:** "10:00 AM" ← **SAME TIME**
   - **Status:** "Scheduled"
3. Click **"Create"**
4. ✅ **Expected Result:** Appointment created successfully!
5. ✅ **Why:** Different service is allowed at same time

---

## ❌ **TEST SCENARIO 2: Same Service, Same Staff, Same Time (Should BLOCK)**

### **Step 1: Try to Create Duplicate**
1. Click **"Create Appointment"** again
2. Fill in:
   - **Client:** Another client (e.g., "Beth Lind I")
   - **Service:** "Botox Injection" ← **SAME AS FIRST**
   - **Staff:** "Stacey Weimann" ← **SAME AS FIRST**
   - **Date:** Same date
   - **Time:** "10:00 AM" ← **SAME TIME**
   - **Status:** "Scheduled"
3. Click **"Create"**
4. ❌ **Expected Result:** Error message!
   - **Error:** "This service is already booked at this time with the same staff member. Please choose a different time or service."
5. ✅ **Why:** Same service + same staff + same time = impossible!
