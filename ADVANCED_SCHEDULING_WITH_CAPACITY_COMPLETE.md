# ✅ Advanced Scheduling with Service Capacity - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 **PANEL REQUIREMENT FULFILLED + ENHANCED**

**Panel Said:** *"Same time and same service will not be approved, but it will depend on the availability of the doctor and other employees"*

**Implemented:** ✅ **Service Capacity Limits** - Maximum concurrent bookings per service

---

## 🔄 **COMPLETE SCHEDULING LOGIC**

### **Rule 1: Different Services, Same Time**
```
✅ 10:00 AM - Botox - Dr. Ve
✅ 10:00 AM - Facial - Dr. Ve
Result: BOTH ALLOWED (Different services)
```

### **Rule 2: Same Service, Same Staff, Same Time**
```
❌ 10:00 AM - Botox - Dr. Ve (1st booking)
❌ 10:00 AM - Botox - Dr. Ve (2nd attempt)
Result: SECOND BLOCKED (Same staff can't do service twice)
```

### **Rule 3: Same Service, Different Staff, Same Time (NEW!)**
```
✅ 10:00 AM - Botox - Dr. Ve (1st booking) → 1/2 capacity
✅ 10:00 AM - Botox - Clinic Staff (2nd booking) → 2/2 capacity FULL
❌ 10:00 AM - Botox - Another Staff (3rd attempt) → BLOCKED (capacity exceeded)
Result: Respects service capacity limit!
```

## 🏥 **SERVICE CAPACITY SETTINGS**

### **What Admins Can Configure:**

When creating/editing services:
- **Max Concurrent Bookings:** 1-10 (Default: 2)

**Examples:**
- **Botox (Max: 2)** - Up to 2 staff can do Botox at same time
- **Consultation (Max: 5)** - Up to 5 staff can consult simultaneously
- **Surgery (Max: 1)** - Only 1 staff can perform surgery at a time

---

## 💡 **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES**

### **Scenario 1: Botox Service (Capacity: 2)**

```
✅ 2:00 PM - Client A - Botox - Dr. Ve → Booked (1/2)
✅ 2:00 PM - Client B - Botox - Clinic Staff → Booked (2/2)
❌ 2:00 PM - Client C - Botox - Any Staff → BLOCKED
   Error: "This service has reached its maximum capacity (2 bookings) at this time."
```

### **Scenario 2: Facial Service (Capacity: 3)**

```
✅ 3:00 PM - Client A - Facial - Staff 1 → Booked (1/3)
✅ 3:00 PM - Client B - Facial - Staff 2 → Booked (2/3)
✅ 3:00 PM - Client C - Facial - Staff 3 → Booked (3/3)
❌ 3:00 PM - Client D - Facial - Any Staff → BLOCKED
   Error: "This service has reached its maximum capacity (3 bookings) at this time."
```

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Database:**
- ✅ Added `max_concurrent_bookings` to `clinic_services` table
- ✅ Default value: 2
- ✅ Range: 1-10

### **Logic:**
```php
// Step 1: Check same staff + same service (always block)
if (same_service && same_staff) → BLOCK

// Step 2: Check service capacity limit
$currentBookings = count(same_service at same_time);
if ($currentBookings >= $service->max_concurrent_bookings) → BLOCK

// Step 3: All checks passed
→ ALLOW
```

### **Error Messages:**
- **Same staff conflict:** "This service is already booked at this time with the same staff member."
- **Capacity exceeded:** "This service has reached its maximum capacity (2 bookings) at this time."
