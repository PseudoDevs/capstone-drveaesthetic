### **Status:** ✅ **Mostly Complete** - Minor enhancements needed

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDATION 2: Pre-Screening Forms Consistency**
**"Same content as pre-screening in the mobile app and web"**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Medical Information Form** - Exists in web
- ✅ **Consent & Waiver Form** - Exists in web
- ⚠️ **Mobile App** - Need to verify forms match

### **Action Required:**
- 📝 Audit mobile app forms to match web forms exactly

- 📝 Ensure field names and structure are identical
- 📝 Document form structure for consistency

### **Status:** ⚠️ **Needs Verification** - Check mobile app consistency

---

## ⚠️ **RECOMMENDATION 3: Advanced Appointment Scheduling Rules**
**"If same time but different service, it will be approved; same time and same service will not be approved, but it will depend on the availability of the doctor and other employees"**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Basic conflict detection** - Exists in `hasTimeConflict()` method
- ❌ **Simple logic** - Blocks ALL same-time appointments

### **Required Changes:**
```php
// CURRENT (Simple):
if same_time → BLOCK

// NEW (Advanced):
if (same_time && same_service && same_staff) → BLOCK
if (same_time && different_service) → ALLOW (staff availability check)
if (same_time && same_service && different_staff) → ALLOW
```

### **Implementation Plan:**
1. Update `hasTimeConflict()` method in Appointment model
2. Add staff availability checking
3. Add service-based conflict detection
4. Update validation messages

### **Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented** - HIGH PRIORITY

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDATION 4: Unified Clinic Forms**
**"The forms of the clinic should be the same forms in the web and mobile app"**
